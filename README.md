# 5 ways on how to be productive with school works #
> ## Here are some tips I have tested which worked in being productive. ##
## 1. Take down notes.
Taking down notes can help you be more focused with the lesson and the notes you're writing can be extremely advantageous as a reviewer for exams, tests, and other assessments. And you'll be alert as well because your fingers would hurt more in writing so you wouldn't feel sleepy during your teachers' discussions.

## 2. Studying with Friends
Studying with friends can be essential since studying with your friends can help you be more aware of what you are studying, your friends can also help you in subjects or homeworks you're having difficulty with.

## 3. Studying in a cafe
For me, studying in a cafe can help me feel more peaceful, because there are some vibes that makes studying in a cafe different.

## 4. Do the Pomodoro Method
The Pomodoro Mthod is a study method used by some students. It has a 25 - minute interval every time you study. Here is the procedure on how to do the Pomodoro Method.

## 5. Study before you sleep
For me, studying before I sleep makes me more alert than studying during the day. No honking cars, no other people talking, just you and a silent environment.
